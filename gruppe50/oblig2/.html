      More than a Valentine’s day cliche, roses are the most loved flower in the world and with good 
      reason, these flowers are astonishingly versatile. They come in a stunning array of shapes, sizes and
      shades, making them a favourite in yards and gardens around the world. Whats more Roses are 
      edible frequently enjoyed by the ancient Romans and Egyptians. Keep reading if you’d like to learn 
      more fascinating facts about this astonishing bloom.

    <h3>1.ROSES ARE ONE OF THE OLDEST FLOWERS</h3>
    <p>
      Archaeologists have discovered rose fossils that date back as far as 35 million years.
      According to the Guinness Book of World Records, roses are the oldest
      species of plant to be grown as decoration. The rose (genus Rosa, family
      Rosaceae) is the oldest species of plant cultivated and used for decorative
      purposes. Documents dated to AD 50 suggest that ancient Romans grew the
      flowers in vast plantations and local hothouses to ensure a year-round
      supply of medicinal extracts, cooking ingredients and ornamentation.
      Ancient Romans used roses to decorate buildings, furniture and people,
      whilst petals were laid to create rose carpets and walkways.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is evidence dating back 5,000 years when the Chinese and Japanese
      created rose gardens, although it is not known if these were for ornamental
      reasons. Similarly, Theophrastus (382-287 BC) wrote about the cultivation
      of roses in ancient Greece, but not their purpose.
    </p>

    <h3>2.ROSES CAN LIVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME</h3>
    <p>
      Even more shocking, the oldest living rose is 1,000 years old. It grows on
      the wall of the Cathedral of Hildesheim in Germany and its presence is
      documented since A.D. 815. According to the legend, the rosebush
      symbolizes the prosperity of the city of Hildesheim; as long as it flourishes,
      Hildesheim will not decline. In 1945 allied bombers destroyed the
      cathedral, yet the bush survived. Its roots remained intact beneath the
      debris, and soon the bush was growing strong again.  
  </p>
   
  <h3>3.YOU CAN EAT ROSES</h3>
  
  <p>
    While it is true that most people add roses to the garden for their looks
    alone, roses have a long history of being used as food and medicine. Roses
    are classified as “herbs” and as such are recognized as useful plants. Their
    petals are edible and rose water (made from soaking the petals in water) is
    often added to jellies or jams or used as an added flavour in Indian and
    Chinese dishes.
</p>

<p>
  Keep in mind, if you are using roses as food, that they should be chemical-
  free. Don’t use roses that have been sprayed with pesticide or any other
  chemicals, also don’t use cut roses from s flower shop or supermarket
  because they have been grown with many chemicals. Growing your own
  roses is the best way to ensure that you have good roses for your medicine
  cabinet, table, or any other use.
</p>

<h3>4.ROSEHIPS OF SOME ROSE SPECIES ARE KNOWN TO
  BE FULL OG VITAMIN C</h3>

  <p>
    Roses also grow a berry-shaped fruit commonly referred to as ‘rose hips’.
    The fruit can be orange, red, dark purple, or even black. Rose hips are
    packed with vitamin C and can be dried to create a refreshing tea. This is
    why rosehips are sometimes used to create jam, jelly & marmalade. The
    hip also has minor medicinal uses, used in food supplements and can be
    pressed or filtered to make rose hip syrup.
</p>

<h3>5.THEIR FRAGRANCE IS USED TO MAKE PERFUMES</h3>

<p>
  We all know the saying: Stop and smell the roses. Well, roses weren’t
  chosen for this phrase by chance; their lovely aroma is a popular floral
  scent and is even used in many perfumes.
</p>

<p>
  Specifically, rose oil has been an important ingredient in the perfume
  industry for centuries. The process of extracting rose oil from flowers
  requires a huge amount of roses; just one gram of oil is produced from two
  thousand roses. The rose scent comes from microscopic perfume glands
  on the petals.
</p>

<p>
  I was astonished to learn that the Rose Valley in Bulgaria produces 85% of
  the world’s rose oil.
</p>

<p>
  The rose scent is one of the flower’s most treasured characteristics. Greeks
  and Romans made perfume from roses, and to this day, their scent is an
  important element in many of the world’s best and most successful
  perfume blends. Centifolia and damask roses are the most common
  choices used to make perfume. The petals are gathered at night as they are
   at their most fragrant just before sunrise. The essential oils are extracted
   and used to mix other ingredients in order to make perfume.
</p>

<P>
  Rosewater is a by-product of the process that makes rose oil. Rosewater is
  used in perfumes and also in cosmetics, as a flavouring, and in medicines.
  It is also used in Middle Eastern cuisine, also referred to as ‘rose syrup’, the
  French use it as a flavouring. The rose-flavoured liquid is added to desserts,
  meringue, marshmallows, and drinks for a distinctive taste.

<h3>6.EACH ROSE COLOUR HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING</h3>

<p>
  Everyone knows that roses have long been a symbol of love, but the colour
  choice also plays a role in what a rose symbolises. Also it is important to
  emphasise that meanings can vary in different cultures.
</p>

<p>
  The following rose colours in the western world are commonly associated 
  with the following meanings:
</p>

  <p>Most of the genes we talk about encode proteins. The information
     in DNA is transcribed into a messenger RNA, which is then 
     translated into a protein. If the protein's not made, 
     then the gene doesn't do anything. But we've known for nearly 70 
     years that this isn't the only option. A number of genes that are 
     transcribed into RNA aren't translated into proteins. Instead, 
     the RNA performs a critical function.
  </p>

<p>Red: Love & Romance</p>
<p>Pink: Grace & Elegance</p>
<p>Yellow: Friendship & Cheer</p>
<p>White: Purity & Innocence & Spirituality</p>
<p>Orange: Enthusiasm & Energy</p>

<h3>7.THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS BLACK ROSE OR BLUE ROSE</h3>
<p>
  Sorry to disappoint, but there is no such thing as ‘black’ roses. What might
  sometimes be referred to as a black rose is actually a dark red rose. A good
  example is “The Black Rose of Turkey”, is a breed that appears pitch-black
  to the eye, but in actuality it is a dark reddish-crimson colour.
</p>

<p>
  True-blue pigments don’t occur naturally in Roses. There are lots of good
  purples among the old roses and hundreds of excellent mauves and lilacs
  were introduced in the 1950s and 1960s (think of Sterling Silver, Lavender
  Dream and Lilac Charm) as the unexpected result of breeding for vigour.
  Rhapsody in Blue, a vigorous shrub with smoky-purple flowers, is one of
  the most popular of modern roses, but it’s not the sort of blue we’re looking
  for.
</p>

<p>
  The truth is that the only way to get clear blues into our roses is by doing
  a bit of genetic modification in the lab. This is something that many people
  disapprove of, conveniently forgetting that the History of all plant-breeding
  is basically a history of genetic improvement. In 2004, researchers used
  genetic modification to create roses that contain the blue pigment
  delphinidin, but such roses still are better described as mauves and lilacs
  not blue.
</p>

<h3>8.THE ROSE IS THE NATIONAL FLOWER</h3>
<p>
    On November 20, 1986, President Ronald Reagan officially made the rose
    the national flower emblem of the United States. He did this while standing
    in the famous White House Rose Garden.
</p>

<p>Various varieties of roses are also the state flower of Georgia, Iowa, New
    York, North Dakota, and Washington, D.C.
</p>

<h3>9.GEORGE WASHINGTON AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN, ARE CONNECTED TO ROSES, BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY</h3>
<p>
  George Washington was the first rose breeder in the United States, and he
  even named a variety after his mother, Mary Washington.  
</p>

<p>
  General Washington served two terms as President, from 1789-1797, and
  then gratefully returned to his plantation, Mount Vernon, to finally become
  the horticulturist he had always wanted to be. Back in Virginia, he polished
  his home, built a gorgeous greenhouse, and oversaw planting food and
  other crops. Washington had an affinity for planting what he called
  ‘Pleasure Gardens.’ These had flowers of every colour and roses that were
  available at the time. He planted native roses, Old Blush, Eglantine, and
  Damask roses. At the time, the petals and hips were used for food, plate
  garnishes, and prized rosewater. According to President Reagan’s
  proclamation, George hybridized a rose and named it after his mother, the
  ‘Mary Washington’ rose, a noisette which is still available today.
</p>

<p>
  In 1865, the Moreau-Robert Nursery of Angers, France, introduced a new
  rose in honour of the fallen American president. They called it ”Souvenir
  du President Lincoln”, surprisingly it is still grown and available. It is very
  full, quartered bloom with an amazing fragrance. It gets huge, arching
  canes and sprays blossoms all over like a giant magenta fountain. It is a
  very hardy rose, repeats well all season long, and is a lasting tribute to 
  Honest Abe.
</p>

<p>
  And then, there is the widely-available rose hybridized by Swim and Weeks
  known as ‘‘Mister Lincoln”. It is a tall hybrid tea with long stems and a big
  bloom. The flowers are a deep, patriotic red and have so much fragrance
  that one can smell them from across the garden.
</p>

<h3>10.THE MOST EXPENSIVE ROSE SOLD FOR MILLIONS OG DOLLARS</h3>
<p>
  Rose breeder David Austin spent $5 million to create the apricot-hued
  hybrid over the course of 15 years. Rose Juliet debuted in 2006 at the
  Chelsea Flower Show and took the floral world by storm not only for its
  blushing beauty but because it was the most expensive rose ever
  developed. The Juliet rose sold for $15.8 million in 2006, which also made it
  the world’s most expensive rose cultivar.

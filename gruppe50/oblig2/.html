    <h2>1.ROSES ARE ONE OF THE OLDEST FLOWERS</h2>
    <p>
      Archaeologists have discovered rose fossils that date back as far as 35 million years.
      According to the Guinness Book of World Records, roses are the oldest
      species of plant to be grown as decoration. The rose (genus Rosa, family
      Rosaceae) is the oldest species of plant cultivated and used for decorative
      purposes. Documents dated to AD 50 suggest that ancient Romans grew the
      flowers in vast plantations and local hothouses to ensure a year-round
      supply of medicinal extracts, cooking ingredients and ornamentation.
      Ancient Romans used roses to decorate buildings, furniture and people,
      whilst petals were laid to create rose carpets and walkways.

      There is evidence dating back 5,000 years when the Chinese and Japanese
      created rose gardens, although it is not known if these were for ornamental
      reasons. Similarly, Theophrastus (382-287 BC) wrote about the cultivation
      of roses in ancient Greece, but not their purpose.

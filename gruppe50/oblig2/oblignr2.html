<h2>1.ROSES ARE ONE OF THE OLDEST FLOWERS</h2>

<p>
    Archaeologists have discovered rose fossils that date back as far as 35 million years.
According to the Guinness Book of World Records, roses are the oldest
species of plant to be grown as decoration. The rose (genus Rosa, family
Rosaceae) is the oldest species of plant cultivated and used for decorative
purposes. Documents dated to AD 50 suggest that ancient Romans grew the
flowers in vast plantations and local hothouses to ensure a year-round
supply of medicinal extracts, cooking ingredients and ornamentation.
Ancient Romans used roses to decorate buildings, furniture and people,
whilst petals were laid to create rose carpets and walkways.

There is evidence dating back 5,000 years when the Chinese and Japanese
created rose gardens, although it is not known if these were for ornamental
reasons. Similarly, Theophrastus (382-287 BC) wrote about the cultivation
of roses in ancient Greece, but not their purpose.

    But that's not to say that newly evolved genes are
    irrelevant to human evolution. A paper released this week looks
    into how a class of new genes evolved since our split with our
    simian relatives. After gaining some insight into how this class
    evolved, the team behind the work looked at one of these newly
    evolved genes and found that it plays a key role in building bigger
    brains.

    <h5>From RNA to proteins</h5>

    <p>Most of the genes we talk about encode proteins. The information
       in DNA is transcribed into a messenger RNA, which is then 
       translated into a protein. If the protein's not made, 
       then the gene doesn't do anything. But we've known for nearly 70 
       years that this isn't the only option. A number of genes that are 
       transcribed into RNA aren't translated into proteins. Instead, 
       the RNA performs a critical function.

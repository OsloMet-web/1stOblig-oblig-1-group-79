<h2>1.ROSES ARE ONE OF THE OLDEST FLOWERS</h2>

<p>
    Archaeologists have discovered rose fossils that date back as far as 35 million years.
According to the Guinness Book of World Records, roses are the oldest
species of plant to be grown as decoration. The rose (genus Rosa, family
Rosaceae) is the oldest species of plant cultivated and used for decorative
purposes. Documents dated to AD 50 suggest that ancient Romans grew the
flowers in vast plantations and local hothouses to ensure a year-round
supply of medicinal extracts, cooking ingredients and ornamentation.
Ancient Romans used roses to decorate buildings, furniture and people,
whilst petals were laid to create rose carpets and walkways.

There is evidence dating back 5,000 years when the Chinese and Japanese
created rose gardens, although it is not known if these were for ornamental
reasons. Similarly, Theophrastus (382-287 BC) wrote about the cultivation
of roses in ancient Greece, but not their purpose.

<h2>2.ROSES CAN LIVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME</h2>
<p>
    Even more shocking, the oldest living rose is 1,000 years old. It grows on
    the wall of the Cathedral of Hildesheim in Germany and its presence is
    documented since A.D. 815. According to the legend, the rosebush
    symbolizes the prosperity of the city of Hildesheim; as long as it flourishes,
    Hildesheim will not decline. In 1945 allied bombers destroyed the
    cathedral, yet the bush survived. Its roots remained intact beneath the
    debris, and soon the bush was growing strong again.

    <h2>3.YOU CAN EAT ROSES</h2>

    <p>While it is true that most people add roses to the garden for their looks
        alone, roses have a long history of being used as food and medicine. Roses
        are classified as “herbs” and as such are recognized as useful plants. Their
        petals are edible and rose water (made from soaking the petals in water) is
        often added to jellies or jams or used as an added flavour in Indian and
        Chinese dishes.

        
        Keep in mind, if you are using roses as food, that they should be chemical-
        free. Don’t use roses that have been sprayed with pesticide or any other
        chemicals, also don’t use cut roses from s flower shop or supermarket
        because they have been grown with many chemicals. Growing your own
        roses is the best way to ensure that you have good roses for your medicine
        cabinet, table, or any other use.

        <h1>How humans got a new gene that makes our brains larger</h1>
        <h2>Somewhere between chimps and us, an RNA started producing a useful protein.</h2>

<h4>Enlarge <span style="color: black">/ Building a bigger brain requires new genes, not a workout.</span></h4> 

<p>On the DNA level, there's not much to distinguish humans from our closet relatives:chimpanzees and
    bonobos.At stretches of DNA that line up, human and chimp sequences are well over 90 percent identical.
    And,for the most part,the DNA does line up at genes;there are very few genes that are either human- or 
    chimp-specific.</p>

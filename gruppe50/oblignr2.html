    edible frequently enjoyed by the ancient Romans and Egyptians. Keep reading if you’d like to learn 
    more fascinating facts about this astonishing bloom.
</p>
<h2>1.ROSES ARE ONE OF THE OLDEST FLOWERS</h2>

<p>
    Archaeologists have discovered rose fossils that date back as far as 35 million years.
According to the Guinness Book of World Records, roses are the oldest
species of plant to be grown as decoration. The rose (genus Rosa, family
Rosaceae) is the oldest species of plant cultivated and used for decorative
purposes. Documents dated to AD 50 suggest that ancient Romans grew the
flowers in vast plantations and local hothouses to ensure a year-round
supply of medicinal extracts, cooking ingredients and ornamentation.
Ancient Romans used roses to decorate buildings, furniture and people,
whilst petals were laid to create rose carpets and walkways.
</p>

<p>
There is evidence dating back 5,000 years when the Chinese and Japanese
created rose gardens, although it is not known if these were for ornamental
reasons. Similarly, Theophrastus (382-287 BC) wrote about the cultivation
of roses in ancient Greece, but not their purpose.
</p>



<h2>2.ROSES CAN LIVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME</h2>
<p>
    Even more shocking, the oldest living rose is 1,000 years old. It grows on
    the wall of the Cathedral of Hildesheim in Germany and its presence is
    documented since A.D. 815. According to the legend, the rosebush
    symbolizes the prosperity of the city of Hildesheim; as long as it flourishes,
    Hildesheim will not decline. In 1945 allied bombers destroyed the
    cathedral, yet the bush survived. Its roots remained intact beneath the
    debris, and soon the bush was growing strong again.  
</p>
   
    <h2>3.YOU CAN EAT ROSES</h2>

    <p>While it is true that most people add roses to the garden for their looks
        alone, roses have a long history of being used as food and medicine. Roses
        are classified as “herbs” and as such are recognized as useful plants. Their
        petals are edible and rose water (made from soaking the petals in water) is
        often added to jellies or jams or used as an added flavour in Indian and
        Chinese dishes.
    </p>

    <p>Keep in mind, if you are using roses as food, that they should be chemical-
        free. Don’t use roses that have been sprayed with pesticide or any other
        chemicals, also don’t use cut roses from s flower shop or supermarket
        because they have been grown with many chemicals. Growing your own
        roses is the best way to ensure that you have good roses for your medicine
        cabinet, table, or any other use.
    </p>

    <h2>4.ROSEHIPS OF SOME ROSE SPECIES ARE KNOWN TO
        BE FULL OG VITAMIN C
    </h2>

    <p>Roses also grow a berry-shaped fruit commonly referred to as ‘rose hips’.
        The fruit can be orange, red, dark purple, or even black. Rose hips are
        packed with vitamin C and can be dried to create a refreshing tea. This is
        why rosehips are sometimes used to create jam, jelly & marmalade. The
        hip also has minor medicinal uses, used in food supplements and can be
        pressed or filtered to make rose hip syrup.</p>

    
        <h2>5.THEIR FRAGRANCE IS USED TO MAKE PERFUMES</h2>
        <p>We all know the saying: Stop and smell the roses. Well, roses weren’t
            chosen for this phrase by chance; their lovely aroma is a popular floral
            scent and is even used in many perfumes.</p>

        <p>Specifically, rose oil has been an important ingredient in the perfume
            industry for centuries. The process of extracting rose oil from flowers
            requires a huge amount of roses; just one gram of oil is produced from two
            thousand roses. The rose scent comes from microscopic perfume glands
            on the petals.</p>

        <p>I was astonished to learn that the Rose Valley in Bulgaria produces 85% of
            the world’s rose oil.</p>

        <p>The rose scent is one of the flower’s most treasured characteristics. Greeks
            and Romans made perfume from roses, and to this day, their scent is an
            important element in many of the world’s best and most successful
            perfume blends. Centifolia and damask roses are the most common
            choices used to make perfume. The petals are gathered at night as they are
             at their most fragrant just before sunrise. The essential oils are extracted
             and used to mix other ingredients in order to make perfume.</p>

        <P>Rosewater is a by-product of the process that makes rose oil. Rosewater is
            used in perfumes and also in cosmetics, as a flavouring, and in medicines.
            It is also used in Middle Eastern cuisine, also referred to as ‘rose syrup’, the
            French use it as a flavouring. The rose-flavoured liquid is added to desserts,
            meringue, marshmallows, and drinks for a distinctive taste.</P>

<h2>6.EACH ROSE COLOUR HAS A DIFFERENT MEANING</h2>
<p>Everyone knows that roses have long been a symbol of love, but the colour
    choice also plays a role in what a rose symbolises. Also it is important to
    emphasise that meanings can vary in different cultures.</p>

<p>The following rose colours in the western world are commonly associated 
    with the following meanings:</p>

<p>Red: Love & Romance</p>
<p>Pink: Grace & Elegance</p>
<p>Yellow: Friendship & Cheer</p>
<p>White: Purity & Innocence & Spirituality</p>
<p>Orange: Enthusiasm & Energy</p>

    More than a Valentine’s day cliche, roses are the most loved flower in the world and with good 
    reason, these flowers are astonishingly versatile. They come in a stunning array of shapes, sizes and
    shades, making them a favourite in yards and gardens around the world. Whats more Roses are 
    edible frequently enjoyed by the ancient Romans and Egyptians. Keep reading if you’d like to learn 
    more fascinating facts about this astonishing bloom.

    That has meant most of the focus on understanding human 
    evolution has been on small changes that can alter the timing
    or level of gene activity, and thus have an effect that's not
    proportionate to the number of bases changed.

<p>
    But that's not to say that newly evolved genes are
    irrelevant to human evolution. A paper released this week looks
    into how a class of new genes evolved since our split with our
    simian relatives. After gaining some insight into how this class
    evolved, the team behind the work looked at one of these newly
    evolved genes and found that it plays a key role in building bigger
    brains.

    <h5>From RNA to proteins</h5>

    <p>Most of the genes we talk about encode proteins. The information
       in DNA is transcribed into a messenger RNA, which is then 
       translated into a protein. If the protein's not made, 
       then the gene doesn't do anything. But we've known for nearly 70 
       years that this isn't the only option. A number of genes that are 
       transcribed into RNA aren't translated into proteins. Instead, 
       the RNA performs a critical function.

        <h1>How humans got a new gene that makes our brains larger</h1>
        <h2>Somewhere between chimps and us, an RNA started producing a useful protein.</h2>

<p>On the DNA level, there's not much to distinguish humans from our closet relatives:chimpanzees and
    bonobos.At stretches of DNA that line up, human and chimp sequences are well over 90 percent identical.
    And,for the most part,the DNA does line up at genes;there are very few genes that are either human- or 
    chimp-specific.</p>
<p>
    That has meant most of the focus on understanding human 
    evolution has been on small changes that can alter the timing
    or level of gene activity, and thus have an effect that's not
    proportionate to the number of bases changed.

    <h1>What is the disadvantages and advantages of working in groups</h1>
    <p>One of the disadvantages is that when working in a group, not every voice might be heard. This can happen when the majority “silences” the minority. This “minority” might instead just agree openly whilst disagreeing internally, leaving out potentially refreshing perspective on the issue.
    </p>
    <p>One og the advantages is that different meanings can give discussions. And discussions are important, then you can reflect over what you are thinking. Here, everyone gets to say what they want to say. And one gets to reflect on the matter. With different thoughts and opinions, one can arrive at multiple solutions.  </p>
    <h2>What do you do if a person does not want to contribute to the group?</h2>
    <p>In that case you can talk with the person and tell them to sharpen up. Remind them that this is a group work. The group itself needs to take some initiative and try to get them to join. Try out online meetings or other suitable things for the person. The group can also discuss what we can do to get this person to participate. If this doesn’t work and the person still doesn’t show up or participate then we may have to drop this person from the group.

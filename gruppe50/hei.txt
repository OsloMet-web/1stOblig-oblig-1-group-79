    <h1>What do you do if a person does not want to contribute to the group?</h1>
    <p>In that case you can talk with the person and tell them to sharpen up. Remind them that this is a group work. The group itself needs to take some initiative and try to get them to join. Try out online meetings or other suitable things for the person. The group can also discuss what we can do to get this person to participate. If this doesn’t work and the person still doesn’t show up or participate then we may have to drop this person from the group.

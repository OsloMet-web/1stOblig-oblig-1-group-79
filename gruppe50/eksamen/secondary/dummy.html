            <h1>Study areas</h1>
            <p>With the advent of digital media, the potential for fake news, 
                bullshit and alternative facts have proliferated. The creation 
                of images, sound and text through artificial intelligence could 
                increase the speed and scale of this phenomenon and drastically 
                influence how we interpret current events, further influencing our 
                political attitudes and elections.
                The use of AI-generated images have already been used in the U.S 
                election campaign leading up to the coming 2024 Presidential Election
            
                In 2025 Norway will host its Parliamentary Election, how should we 
                prepare for the use of this technology? 
            </p>
            <p>The Norwegian government have asked for advice on how to deal with the use 
                of AI in political campaigns and elections. The current government proposal 
                is that a law should be in place before the 2025 Norwegian election, banning 
                all use of AI in political campaigns—including all AI-generated text, images, 
                sound, and video. 
                Should this law be implemented, and what might be the consequences? Your group 
                will use the form below to keep notes from your discussions and make a final 
                decision on your recommendation, to pass this law or not.
